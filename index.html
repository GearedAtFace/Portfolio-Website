It began as a personal project looking into creating generation similar to the Dungeoneering dungeons from Runescape. Eventually the project was merged into a group project as a final for a class where we worked for just under a month on making it into a basic game. The simplified explaination of the progression is that you start with a colored key and can enter doors that match that color. Those doors lead to a miniboss where upon defeating them you obtain a different colored key and repeat this process untill reaching the final boss.</div>

Instead of the goal being to simply land on a single planet using limited fuel you start in orbit of a planet and have to travel to other planets where you can land and refuel to again travel to yet another planet. This project is still a work in progress but the goal will either be to reach a home planet or you gain score as you succesfully land on larger or further planets.</div>

The original idea was a game similar to the old Namco arcade game, Bosconian, but with a procedurally generated map. My main job on this project was to create a infinitely generating map using a given set of map tiles we created. I also had to implement a system that loads and unloads these tiles as you progress around the map as storing them all put a lot of stress on the computer.</div>
