While my main job was the art I helped with most parts of the project such as debugging, balance, custom controller support, weapon mechanics, and more.</div>

It began as a personal project looking into creating generation similar to the Dungeoneering dungeons from Runescape. Eventually the project was merged into a group project as a final for a class where we worked for just under a month on making it into a basic game. The simplified explaination of the progression is that you start with a colored key and can enter doors that match that color. Those doors lead to a miniboss where upon defeating them you obtain a different colored key and repeat this process untill reaching the final boss.</div>

I worked on this over two weeks with one other classmate for my VR class on an Oculus. It features a system where we can turn anything into a weapon you can grab and attack with, whether thats the sword and pickaxe the player is given or the dead slimes you kill and trees that decorate the level.</div>

The server is no longer running so it's unusable currently however when it was running it worked with my partners server which was written in Rust to send and recieve files of any type. It worked through a command line where you could request a list of files the server contained, request the index of a file and then either view or save the file selected. You could also upload files by entering their location on your computer or upload text files written right into the command line. </div>
